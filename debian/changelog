  *   * **Breaking:** This is a major release and while we tried to keep
    things compatible for most users, you might want to have a look at
    the [UPGRADE](UPGRADE-2.0.md) guides
    * Many CPU and memory performance improvements
    * The update command is now much more deterministic as it does not
    take the already installed packages into account
    * Package installation now performs all network operations first
    before doing any changes on disk, to reduce the chances of ending up
    with a partially updated vendor dir
    * Partial updates and require/remove are now much faster as they
    only load the metadata required for the updated packages
    * Added a [platform-check step](doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check)
    when vendor/autoload.php gets initialized which checks the current
    PHP version/extensions match what is expected and fails hard
    otherwise. Can be disabled with the platform-check config option
    * Added a [`Composer\InstalledVersions`](doc/07-runtime.md#installed-
    versions) class which is autoloaded in every project and lets you
    check which packages/versions are present at runtime
    * Added a `composer-runtime-api` virtual package which you can
    require (as e.g. `^2.0`) to ensure things like the InstalledVersions
    class above are present. It will effectively force people to use
    Composer 2.x to install your project
    * Added support for parallel downloads of package metadata and zip
    files, this requires that the curl extension is present and we thus
    strongly recommend enabling curl
    * Added much clearer dependency resolution error reporting for
    common error cases
    * Added support for updating to a specific version with partial
    updates, as well as a [--with flag](doc/03-cli.md#update--u) to pass
    in temporary constraint overrides
    * Added support for TTY mode on Linux/OSX/WSL so that script
    handlers now run in interactive mode
    * Added `only`, `exclude` and `canonical` options to all
    repositories, see [repository
    priorities](https://getcomposer.org/repoprio) for details
    * Added support for lib-zip platform package
    * Added `pre-operations-exec` event to be fired before the packages
    get installed/upgraded/removed
    * Added `pre-pool-create` event to be fired before the package pool
    for the dependency solver is created, which lets you modify the list
    of packages going in
    * Added `post-file-download` event to be fired after package dist
    files are downloaded, which lets you do additional checks on the
    files
    * Added --locked flag to `show` command to see the packages from the
    composer.lock file
    * Added --unused flag to `remove` command to make sure any packages
    which are not needed anymore get removed
    * Added --dry-run flag to `require` and `remove` commands
    * Added --no-install flag to `update`, `require` and `remove`
    commands to disable the install step and only do the update step
    (composer.lock file update)
    * Added --with-dependencies and --with-all-dependencies flag aliases
    to `require` and `remove` commands for consistency with `update`
    * Added more info to `vendor/composer/installed.json`, a dev key
    stores whether dev requirements were installed, and every package
    now has an install-path key with its install location
    * Added COMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK which if set makes Composer do its
    best to run offline. This can be useful when you have poor
    connectivity or to do benchmarking without network jitter
    * Added --json and --merge flags to `config` command to allow
    editing complex `extra.*` values by using json as input
    * Added confirmation prompt when running Composer as superuser in
    interactive mode
    * Added --no-check-version to `validate` command to remove the
    warning in case the version is defined
    * Added --ignore-platform-req (without s) to all commands supporting
    --ignore-platform-reqs, which accepts a package name so you can
    ignore only specific     platform requirements
    * Added support for wildcards (`*`) in classmap autoloader paths
    * Added support for configuring GitLab deploy tokens in addition to
    private tokens, see [gitlab-token](doc/06-config.md#gitlab-token)
    * Added support for package version guessing for require and init
    command to take all platform packages into account, not just php
    version
    * Fixed package ordering when autoloading and especially when
    loading plugins, to make sure dependencies are loaded before their
    dependents
    * Fixed suggest output being very spammy, it now is only one line
    long and shows more rarely
    * Fixed conflict rules like e.g. >=5 from matching dev-master, as it
    is not normalized to 9999999-dev internally anymore
